exp 1 : Image Resizing 
When the python image is resized, the interpolation method defines how the new pixels are computed. There are several interpolation techniques, each of which has its own quality vs. speed trade-offs.

exp 1 A :Image Rotation
Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor

exp 1 B : Image Translation
Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.

exp 1 C : Image shearing is a geometric transformation that skews an image along one or both axes i.e x or y axis.

exp 1 D : Image Normalization
Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range.This is often done to improve the performance of image processing algorithms, as many algorithms work better when the pixel values are within a certain range.

exp 1 E :Edge detection of Image
The process of image edge detection involves detecting sharp edges in the image. This edge detection is essential in the context of image recognition or object localization/detection. There are several algorithms for detecting edges due to its wide applicability.

exp 1 F :Image Blurring
Image blurring is the technique of reducing the detail of an image by averaging the pixel values in the neighborhood.

exp 1 G :Morphological Image Processing
Morphological image processing is a set of python image processing techniques based on the geometry of objects in an image. These procedures are commonly used to eliminate noise, separate objects, and detect edges in images
